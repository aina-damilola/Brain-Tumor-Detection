# Brain-Tumor-Detection

Currently, medical professionals use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to visually identify brain tumours. However, the manual identification of brain tumours can be challenging due to the large number of images produced from one MRI scan. Additionally, the large variety of brain tumour sizes, shapes, and locations makes it even so more challenging to detect and classify different types of brain tumours. Applying deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (which exhibit high proficiency in image classification tasks), can result in faster processing of MRI images and more accurate detection of brain tumours by eliminating human error. This project aims to produce a convolutional neural network model that can accurately detect and classify 3 different types of brain tumours: 
 - Glioma
 - Meningioma
 - Pituitary
